## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a 'found document' from the Gilded Creek archive: a miner's letter home, a company ledger entry showing 'spiritual obstruction' as a cost, a child's drawing of the smelter smoke as a monster, or a botanical sketch from Cora's garden with notes on medicinal vs. metallic properties.
- Create a monologue from the perspective of the Mountain/Ajax Vein. How does it perceive the drills, the men, the Thorns and the Gages? What does it want?
- Draft a scene set 20 years after the novel's end. Who is living in the Ajax house? What grows in the garden? What story do the old-timers in the (now maybe touristy) town tell about 'the trouble at the Ajax'?
- Write a 'prequel' scene: young Hiram Gage first arriving at the claim. What did he experience that made him shift from prospector to guardian? Or, write the moment the Van Slyke Consortium in New York decides to send Silas Thorne.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive map of Gilded Creek and the Ajax Mountain, tagging locations with 'audio lore' (snippets of dialogue, environmental sounds, the 'song' of the vein) and 'extractive data' (mine yields, pollution levels, company valuations).
- Create a 'Dual-Ledger' visualization tool. One side tracks Silas's world: financial costs, ore tonnage, payroll. The other tracks Cora and Hiram's world: water purity, bee colony health, tree blight, strange seismic readings. Show how actions in one ledger affect the other.

## Origin

Generated through persona500's Council-Prism Generation.
SASI evaluation: 8/10

Council: Nathaniel Hawthorne (for moral allegory buried in a specific, grim locale), Ursula K. Le Guin (for the conflict between extractive and ecological worldviews, and the 'language' of place), Cormac McCarthy (for the stark, poetic prose of violence and landscape in the American West), Charlotte Perkins Gilman (for the critique of patriarchal capitalism and the exploration of alternative, often domestic/spatial, modes of resistance)
